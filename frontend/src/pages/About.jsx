            Rotary Club of Avinashi has the distinction of being the 1st Rotary Club in Avinashi and the 5th club in Tamilnadu after Chennai, Coimbatore, Ooty and Salem. It was sponsored by RC – Coimbatore and was chartered on 27/5/1955 with 20 members in the then Rotary District 320. Rotary in Avinashi, represented by one club with 20 members, has now grown into 28 clubs with more than 2000 members. What a phenomenal growth! It's a reflection of the economic status of Avinashi city and the mental attitude of people who are ever willing to share their prosperity and happiness with the under privileged.

            The charter President of our club was Rtn. M. N. Veerabhada Chettiar of the famous Dhanalaakshmi Mills and charter Secretary was Rtn. S. R. Shammugam. Our club has sponsored RCs of Avinashi South, North, Dharapuram, Avinashi, Palladam, Avinashi Next Generation and hence is fondly called the Grandfather Club. Many of our erstwhile members, one of the notable ones being Padmashri A. Sakthivel, Chairman,Apparel Export Promotion Council are responsible for the development and growth of Avinashi and its export industry.

            Our club is proud to have as our member, our past district Governor Dr. A Muruganathan whose unstinted support and guidance have enabled us to execute many projects in and around Avinashi for the betterment of the society. The flagship project of our club is the Rotary Matriculation School, with a built up area of 20,000 sq ft. It was established in 1963 and like our club has the distinction of being the 1st English medium school in Avinashi. Our club is fortunate to command the respect of all the clubs in the district. One should be lucky and proud to become a Rotarian in our club.
